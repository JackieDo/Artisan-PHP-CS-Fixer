> The PHP Coding Standards Fixer tool fixes most issues in your code when you want to follow the PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1 and PSR-2 documents and many more.

> If you are already using a linter to identify coding standards problems in your code, you know that fixing them by hand is tedious, especially on large projects. This tool does not only detect them, but also fixes them for you.

## Configuration
To change the configuration of the fixer with your own purpose, you need publish the configuration file with the artisan `vendor:publish` as follow:

```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Jackiedo\ArtisanPhpCsFixer\ArtisanPhpCsFixerServiceProvider"
```

This will create one file named `.php-cs-fixer.php` in the root directory of your project. This file is returned an instance of `PhpCsFixer\ConfigInterface` which lets you configure the rules, the files and directories that need to be analyzed. From now and then, you can share this file with all of your developing team members. The rest is you have to think of a way to always sync this file for your team.

## Exclusion of the cache file
Whenever you run the artisan `php-cs-fixer:fix` command, one file with named `.php-cs-fixer.cache` will be created at the root directory of your project. You can exclude this file by append following line into `.gitignore` file:

```
.php-cs-fixer.cache
```
